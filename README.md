# Orthodox Keyboard Case

Designed for [Orthodox](https://monkeebs.ca/orthodox-rev-3-14.html) which is created by Deductivemonkee.  
Modified based on Skatardude10â€™s [Orthodox 3D Printable Switch Plate](https://odoxcases.blogspot.com/2017/11/orthodox-3d-printable-switch-plate.html) and added some tweaks around thumb keys to fit Rev 3.14 PCB more properly.
